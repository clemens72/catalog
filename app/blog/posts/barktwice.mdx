##Lyrics
I tell you one thing
it ain't what it looks like
unless it looks like
We're having a good time
I can say
This much is true
If you got holes in your pockets
you better have nothin to lose

when the taxman cometh
to get what you owe
if you've been slippin
you're gonna reap what you sow
united we're good
and divided we cower
Who could have guessed
no one man should have all that power

you gotta bark twice
if you're losing it all
don't be a tough guy
when there's feelings involved
meet me half way
cause two heads are better
together we'll get it
but first we gotta get it together
