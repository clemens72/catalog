They say it's cold outside
I wonder if they know
What Santa feels like
Top down in the snow

Not getting younger
But we get more naughty than nice
Still makes the trip each year
Bigger bag of coal each time

We're throwing parties
While the elves work overtime
Make a plate of gingerbread
And fill up a cup
Milk's out for Santa

It ain't crazy to think
We're running out of time
Old traditions fading
We made a life a lifeline

Rudolph's nose
Nobody knows
The trouble that comes
When the red light goes

We're throwing parties
While the elves work overtime
Make a plate of gingerbread
And fill up a cup
Milk's out for Santa

Rudolph,
You don't have put on a red light

I know it's rough
But the red man's tough
So fill up a cup its
Milks out for Santa

Rudolph,
You don't have put on a red light

Get us all our presents
He clocks in overtime
Not keeping the season bright

Carrying more coal each time

Seems every year we have less cheer
And guess who pays the price

Chestnuts are roasting 
By the fires and wreathes
