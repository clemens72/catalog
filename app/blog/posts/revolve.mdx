All of my problems
Have one thing common
It's you they revolve around
and I've about lost it

And all of my problems
Revolve around truth
You were a liar
Believed yourself too

She asked for my word
Forever and through
Sickness and wellness
and I said I do

It's fair if you doubt me
Lord knows I do too
But this time we all know
I'm never again gonna use
