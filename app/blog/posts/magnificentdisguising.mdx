How do you hide it so well
Magnificent disguising
I know your every thought
And yet you surprise me
You'll talk your way around it
But you can't hide the truth
It all comes to the surface,
cause I've always been you

Today is the day
we call it our last one
I'll believe it when I see it
Yeah, we both know we ain't done
Ain't done any of the work
You said you would
You keep telling yourself
That you're all good
You keep hiding from the fact
that you can't get it right
Tomorrow (in the morning) we'll talk
But you own the night

I wonder how you hide it so well

I can't help but believe
There's a future in sight
My patience is thin
And you'll keep on lying

You'll keep on lying to me
You'll keep on lying to you

So okay, alright, fine
we'll do this again
I'm praying this time
you don't leave me on read
You say you want help
I'll do everything thing I can
But I'm at the end of my rope
I'll give you one more
One more chance

[Bridge]
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
But god damn we are way past three
You'll talk your way around it
but you cant hide the truth
It all comes to the surface
cause I've always been you
