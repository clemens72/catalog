I'm really tired of pretending I'm right
And also cause I can't sleep at night
It's like a broken record stuck on max
I gotta come clean, here's the facts

I tell myself just truly be me
But see, therein lies trickery
We have empathy for those in need
keep that in mind when I promise it's me

Step back, self aware, do you see what I mean
Do you have several specific routines?
And do you recollect the things that you do?
Or block it out because there's more to consume?

One more season, in the meantime
Seven other dramas occupy my mind
No wonder I struggle tryna sleep at night
There's a world wide net working to steal our time

I feel dumb saying money is time
We're taught it's better if you stay in line
So if we don't skip over cliches
Maybe we don't have to feel this way
