Holes in my pockets

Ooh the taxman's on the way
to reap just what I sow
I get more love every day
but love's not what I owe
in trying times I've come to find
one thing is always true
If I got holes in my pockets, I'm alright
'cause I got nothing to lose

Ok the first time
I lost my mind
Was thinking that I needed more stuff
So I scoured and searched
And lost my self worth
I went from smooth sailing into the rough
And when I ran out stuff
It didn't give me enough
I didn't think there was another way up
So then I finished my fall,
Saw through it all
And all I wanted was just real love
And some stuff too

I'll be coming round again
saying things I shouldn't have said
If they get their hands on me
then I'll be doing time again
