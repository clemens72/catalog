out in the desert
no souls around
feeling the pressure
hot on the ground
wind in his face
his tail is draggin
then he sees a trace
of another dragon

and he says "ooh"
I see you ain't playing around
but i'm the baddest dragon in this forsaken town
other dragon says "ooh
you know I'm wearing the crown
but get your donkey ready
cause it's bout to go down

They call him Toto
last of his kind
Komodo dragons
fight to survive
they work alone
it's hard to thrive
so now it's Toto
end of the line
