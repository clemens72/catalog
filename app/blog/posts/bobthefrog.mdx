Down in the swamps near the Georgia pines
He held his chin up high
And as his tummy grumbled, he pondered why
there's so much more food in the sky

Oh, Bob the frog wants to fly
More than anything
But he fears for his life, and he starts to cry
Cause poor old Bob ain't got wings

He remembers the days, when he was a tad
He had no legs, a rough time for the lad
But with a fighting spirit, a want that was bad
He grew those limbs he never had

Oh, but Bob the frog wants to fly
More than anything
But his fighting spirit, his life need not fear it
Cause this frog is gettin' his wings

Now froggy went a courtin, and oh did he ride
he spent all his day eating up all the flies
some magic was stirrin, his tummy was purrin
he grew him some wings and he shot for the skies

Oh, Bob the frog wants to fly
More than anything
From his humble abode, he cracked genetic code
And our boy got himself some wings

Oh, Bob the frog wants to fly
More than anything
And Bob the frog's a happy guy
Cause Bob the frog got wings
